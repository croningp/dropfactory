## Oil Stirring Station

In each oil vials, there is a small magnetic stirrer. At the stirring station (position 3 of the oil wheel) a compact magnetic stirrer ensure the oils are fully mixed before being sampled by the syringe. Such small magnetic stirrers tends to over heat, for this reason a fan has been positioned below the stirrer to regulate its temperature.
